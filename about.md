## Me

![Dexter and I](/assets/images/me-and-dog.jpg)

My name is Ewald Zietsman and I am a software developer with a background in
Geomatics and Astrophysics. I live in Cape Town, South Africa.  I'm currently
working in the education technology sector. I like to build things that are
useful and things that are fun and things that are both ;-) 


## This page

This page was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the fantastic
[Hyde](http://andhyde.com/) theme and is hosted on [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The title graphic is **Solar System**
designed by misirlou from the Noun Project.

I used my ageing Dell XPS M1530 which now thanks to [**\#!** Linux](http://crunchbang.org/) has 
a new lease on life (highly recommended lightweight OS) and of course a tricked out VIM `</nerd>`


Please let me know if something on the site doesn't work.


Thanks for reading and leave a comment!
