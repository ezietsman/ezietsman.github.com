My name is Ewald Zietsman and I am a software developer with a background in
Geomatics and Astrophysics. I live in Cape Town, South Africa.  I'm currently
working in the education technology sector. I like to build things that are
useful and things that are fun or things that are both ;-) 

Thanks for reading!
